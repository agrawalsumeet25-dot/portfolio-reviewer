# Common Portfolio Red Flags

Reference for identifying issues during reviews. Organized by severity.

## Critical Red Flags (Instant Rejection Risk)

### 1. No Clear Problem Statement
- Case study jumps straight to solutions without defining the problem
- No explanation of WHY this project mattered
- Missing business context or user pain points
- **Fix**: Lead with a crisp 2-3 sentence problem statement. Include who was affected, what the impact was, and why it needed solving.

### 2. Process Theater
- Shows a "textbook" double diamond or design thinking diagram but doesn't actually demonstrate real process
- Every project follows the exact same cookie-cutter steps
- Research feels performative — "We did 5 user interviews" with no insight about what was learned
- **Fix**: Show messy reality. What surprised you? What assumption was wrong? What did you learn that changed direction?

### 3. No Measurable Outcomes
- Case study ends at the final mockup with no results
- "Users loved it" without data
- No before/after comparison
- **Fix**: Include metrics even if approximate — task completion improvement, conversion lift, support ticket reduction, NPS change. If no metrics, explain what you'd measure and why.

### 4. Unclear Role & Contribution
- "We" throughout without specifying what YOU did
- Team of 8 but individual contribution unclear
- **Fix**: Be explicit. "I led the research phase, conducting 12 user interviews. The visual design was handled by [name]. I synthesized findings into..."

### 5. Wall of Text / No Scannability
- Dense paragraphs with no visual breaks
- No section headings or clear structure
- Hiring managers spend <60 seconds scanning — if they can't skim it, they won't read it
- **Fix**: Clear section headers, pull quotes for key insights, visual breaks every 300-400 words

## Major Red Flags (Weakens Candidacy)

### 6. Pretty Pictures, No Thinking
- High-fidelity mockups but no evidence of ideation, sketches, or exploration
- No wireframes, user flows, or information architecture
- Looks like a Dribbble shot, not a case study
- **Fix**: Show the journey — rough sketches, whiteboard photos, iteration comparisons, decision rationale

### 7. Missing Constraints & Trade-offs
- Everything worked perfectly with no challenges
- No mention of technical constraints, timeline pressure, or stakeholder disagreements
- **Fix**: Senior designers navigate constraints. Show what you compromised on and why. "We had 6 weeks instead of 12, so I prioritized..."

### 8. Generic Research
- Personas that look like they came from a template
- Journey maps with no real insights
- Competitive analysis that lists features without analysis
- **Fix**: Show ONE real insight that changed your design direction. That's worth more than 10 template deliverables.

### 9. No Mobile / Responsive Consideration
- Only desktop mockups shown
- No mention of cross-platform experience
- **Fix**: Show responsive thinking even if brief — key breakpoints, mobile-specific interactions

### 10. Outdated Visual Design
- Design patterns from 2018 (hamburger menus everywhere, drop shadows, skeuomorphism where inappropriate)
- Stock photos instead of real content
- **Fix**: Study current design systems (Material 3, Apple HIG 2025, Fluent). Use realistic content.

## Minor Red Flags (Polish Issues)

### 11. Inconsistent Typography/Spacing
- Mixed font sizes without hierarchy logic
- Inconsistent padding/margins between sections
- **Fix**: Establish a type scale and spacing system. Be consistent.

### 12. No Call-to-Action
- Portfolio ends without telling the viewer what to do next
- No contact info, LinkedIn, or availability status
- **Fix**: End with clear CTA — "Available for opportunities starting [date]. Email me at..."

### 13. Too Many Projects
- 8+ case studies of varying quality
- **Fix**: 2-4 strong case studies beat 8 mediocre ones. Quality over quantity.

### 14. Spelling/Grammar Errors
- Shows lack of attention to detail
- Especially bad for UX designers who should care about content
- **Fix**: Proofread. Get someone else to review.

### 15. Slow Loading / Broken Links
- Images not optimized, page takes 5+ seconds
- Links to prototypes are broken
- **Fix**: Optimize images, test all links, check on mobile
