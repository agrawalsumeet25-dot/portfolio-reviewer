# Review Framework — What Senior Reviewers Evaluate

## The 3-Second Test
Before anything else, answer: In the first 3 seconds of seeing this page, can you tell:
- What the project is about?
- What the designer's role was?
- Whether this is worth reading further?

If no → that's the #1 problem to fix.

## The 7 Dimensions of a Great Case Study

### 1. Story & Narrative Arc
- Does it follow Problem → Process → Solution → Impact?
- Is there a compelling "hook" at the top?
- Does the narrative have tension? (challenges, pivots, surprises)
- Is the story scannable in 60 seconds but rewarding if read in 5 minutes?
- **Senior marker**: Shows what DIDN'T work and why, not just the happy path

### 2. Strategic Thinking & Business Alignment
- Is the problem framed in business terms, not just design terms?
- Are constraints acknowledged? (timeline, budget, technical, organizational)
- Does the designer show trade-off decisions?
- Is there evidence of stakeholder management?
- **Senior marker**: "We chose X over Y because..." with business justification

### 3. Research & Discovery Rigor
- What research methods were used? Are they appropriate for the problem?
- Are insights SPECIFIC and actionable, not generic?
- Is there evidence of synthesis (not just data collection)?
- Did research actually influence design decisions?
- **Senior marker**: One real insight that changed direction > 10 template deliverables

### 4. Design Craft & Visual Execution
- Is the visual design current and polished?
- Are there clear design decisions with rationale?
- Do interactions feel considered and intentional?
- Is the design system consistent?
- Are there before/after comparisons?
- **Senior marker**: Shows iteration — V1 → V2 → V3 with reasoning

### 5. Outcomes & Impact
- Are there measurable results?
- Are metrics tied back to the original problem?
- Is there a post-launch story? (iteration, monitoring, learning)
- **Senior marker**: Defines success metrics BEFORE launch, then measures against them
- If no hard metrics: proxies (usability test success rates, stakeholder feedback, adoption rates)

### 6. Presentation & Information Design
- Is the case study itself well-designed? (it IS a design artifact)
- Typography, spacing, visual hierarchy within the case study page
- Image quality — are mockups crisp, well-framed, in context?
- Is content density appropriate? (not too sparse, not overwhelming)
- **Senior marker**: The case study page itself demonstrates design skill

### 7. Professional Polish
- Grammar, spelling, punctuation
- Consistent voice and tone
- Working links and prototypes
- Mobile responsiveness of the portfolio itself
- Page load performance
- Clear contact/CTA

## Scoring Guide

For each dimension, rate 1-5:
- **1**: Missing or fundamentally broken
- **2**: Present but weak — needs significant rework
- **3**: Adequate — meets basic expectations
- **4**: Strong — above average, shows skill
- **5**: Exceptional — would impress at FAANG/top agency

**Overall score mapping:**
- 28-35: Ready for senior roles at top companies
- 21-27: Solid portfolio, needs targeted improvements
- 14-20: Needs significant work on multiple dimensions
- 7-13: Fundamental rethink needed

## What Separates Good from Great

Great portfolios show:
1. **Self-awareness** — acknowledgment of mistakes, limitations, learnings
2. **Systems thinking** — how this project fits into the broader product/business
3. **Cross-functional fluency** — speaking engineering and business language, not just design
4. **Ownership mentality** — "I drove this" not "I was assigned this"
5. **Growth narrative** — how this project made them a better designer
